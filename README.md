# MNIST
## Installations:
The project has been done with python 3.6. All the package requires are mentioned in requirement.txt

## Motivation:
This was my very first feed forward neural network(FNN) that is build from sctrach i.e. using only numpy library. It has all the parts of FNN broken into functions.

## Files:
[mnist.py](https://github.com/piyush9923/MNIST/blob/master/mnist.py) contains the code.
Use: python mnist.py to run it

## Conclusion:
Altough the model is not optimized and slow, still the model was able to achieve an accuracy of **90%**
